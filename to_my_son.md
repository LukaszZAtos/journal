One day son...
you'll walk roads I can't fallow,
fight battles I can't shield you from,
and carry weight I can no longer lift.
But my words will walk beside you,
my strenght will echo in your chest.
And when the world tries to break you,
you'll remember,
I didn't raise a child,
I forged a warrior
I love you.
